1. Background-color. div#div1
2. Margin changes the space between the boxes. Padding increases the space around the text in the box.
3. Margin: The <p> element gets pushed outside of the box, disappearing. Padding: the background gets pushed outside of the box but does not disappear.
4. Scroll buts everything inside the box but lets you scroll around. Hidden just cuts it all.
5. Float left makes the order 1,2,3. Right makes it 3,2,1.
6. 	Div1: Goes to the left
	Div2: Goes to the left and 1 and 3 are on the right side on top of each other.
	Div3: Goes to the left and down one
7. All the divs have float left. Div3 has clear left.
8. The margin is removed. The boxes get pushed to the top right corner. It tells us that the default margin value is greater than the 0.
