1. Background-color. div#div1
2. Margin changes the space between the boxes. Padding increases the space around the text in the box.
3. Margin: The <p> element gets pushed outside of the box, disappearing. Padding: the background gets pushed outside of the box but does not disappear.
4. Scroll buts everything inside the box but lets you scroll around. Hidden just cuts it all.
